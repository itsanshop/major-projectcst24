As cities become more densely populated, traffic management becomes increasingly complex. A new smart automatic traffic management system is tackling these challenges by utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) and machine learning technologies. By analyzing real-time traffic data, this innovative system can optimize traffic flow, increase safety, and reduce congestion, providing a seamless transportation experience for all. With features like real-time traffic monitoring, automatic incident detection, and dynamic traffic signal optimization, this system is revolutionizing the way traffic is managed in urban areas. Whether you're driving, walking, or taking public transportation, this system is designed to make your commute safer and more efficient using YOLO Technology. Overall, the smart automatic traffic management system represents a major step forward in urban transportation technology, and has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for millions of people around the world.

Problem Statement

Cities around the world are experiencing increasing traffic congestion, resulting in longer commutes, reduced productivity, and environmental pollution. To mitigate these issues, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive smart traffic management system. The ultimate goal of this smart traffic management system is to improve the quality of life for urban residents by reducing congestion, enhancing safety, and promoting sustainable transportation options while using cutting-edge technology and data-driven insights to achieve these objectives.

Proposed Solution

The suggested model creates a more intelligent, well-organized, and controlled traffic management system by analyzing the presence of vehicles on the road and addressing issues with traffic flow. YOLO, a capable object detection machine learning model, can be used to accomplish this analyze vehicle count based on input from CCTV cameras installed in traffic signals. The traffic data input is passed into the YOLO machine learning model that counts the vehicles based on the object detection in input video stream. YOLO use a totally different approach. In contrast to R-CNN systems, which need thousands of evaluations for a single image, it also generates predictions with a single network assessment. Because of this, it operates at a speed that is over 1000 times quicker than R-CNN and 100 times faster than Fast R-CNN. Benefits of Accuracy and speed (45 frames per second, better than real-time) are two advantages of YOLO over other models has a generalized object representation understanding. The above-described YOLO object detection method can be used to identify a vehicle and its location information from a single picture. However, in actual traffic applications, a continuous image frame is provided as the input. The vehicles detected in different image frames are independent of each other. Therefore, the same vehicle is counted multiple times, and the collected vehicle information would be wrong. To solve this problem, the ID of the detected vehicle must be configured to prevent double counting. In the proposed system, an object counting method is added to correlate and match the vehicles detected in different image frames and to determine whether a detected vehicle is newly added. For the proposed approach to accomplish the goal of vehicle counting, only basic distance computations are needed. Additionally, the system can lessen the effects of incorrect detection by including more checkpoints. The accuracy and overall performance of the suggested system are examined using pictures taken from various viewpoints and locations. The results show that our system can count objects with a high degree of precision in an environment with sufficient daylight.

Proposed Outcome

The primary objective of intelligent traffic management systems is to address the traffic issue that nearly all urban and suburban regions face. Therefore, the goal of the suggested model is to lessen traffic caused by cars. The proposed model decides smart switching timing for the signal on all sides of the road. Hence, people do not want to wait for extended interval of time on the road and provide smooth flow of traffic on the road. Since the system learns from time to time, the system can be updated in future to become fully autonomous with training and learning. Some outcomes include :

The average speed of the cars will drop, which will eventually cause the efficiency of people as a whole to grow quickly, increasing the city's overall efficiency.
Huge manpower is lost for controlling traffic jams across the city using this system.
In case of accidents or emergencies, the system can automatically alert emergency services, reducing the response time significantly. This rapid response can save lives and reduce the severity of accidents.
The tracking algorithm based on CNN is used for tracking the detected vehicle. The parameters which were set for the proposed algorithm, which is the sensitivity with detection rate of 92%, similarly accuracy of about 91.8%, specificity of about 91.2%.
